Having many data science and data analysis youtubers, I did this project to help self taught individuals where to get good content from the most common youtubers
such as Marques Brownlee, Ken Jee and Luke Barousse. I used the google API python client to create a API key. I created a function that could extracted their channel details to aquire data such as 
videos, subscribers,views, total videos and playlist id. I loaded all this data into a pandas data frame which was also saved in a CSV file. I converted all the data types into the right format.I compared the 3 youtubers based on videos posted on individual channels.

I also compared their subscription based on their channels to get insights on whose channel has a larger following.

Quite evidently Marques Brownlee tops the charts among the three and is quite understood quite better than the reset making him one of the best teacher for self taught individuals.
