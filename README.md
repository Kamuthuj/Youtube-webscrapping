Having many data science and data analysis youtubers, I did this project to help self taught individuals where to get good content from the most common youtubers
such as Marques Brownlee, Ken Jee and Luke Barousse. I used the google API python client to create a API key. I created a function that could extracted their channel details to aquire data such as 
videos, subscribers,views, total videos and playlist id. I loaded all this data into a pandas data frame which was also saved in a CSV file. I converted all the data types into the right format.I compared the 3 youtubers based on their subscribers
and their viewership.
